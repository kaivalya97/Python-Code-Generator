# Python Code Generator
Python Code Generator is a GUI based application written in Java using Javax Swing. The main aim of this application is to ease the process of code writing and eliminating syntax errors. It has very basic functions at this stage but we aim to make it a complete solution for competitive programmers. 

This was our 2nd Semester B.Tech Project for the Object Oriented Programming course. The user has an intuitive UI to work with where they can easily generate syntactically correct Python code based entirely on logic.
